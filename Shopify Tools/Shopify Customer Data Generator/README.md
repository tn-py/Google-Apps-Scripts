# Random Customer Data Generator Script

## Overview

It prompts the user to specify the number of customer records desired and then populates the spreadsheet with randomly generated data that aligns with predefined headers.

## Features

- **Dynamic Data Generation**: Generates data for various fields including names, email addresses, marketing preferences, addresses, phone numbers, tags, notes, and tax exemption status.
- **Customizable Row Count**: Users can specify the number of rows of data they want to generate, from just a few to several hundred.
- **User-friendly Prompt**: A simple UI prompt allows users to easily enter the desired number of customer records.
- **Predefined Headers Support**: Designed to work with a specific set of headers, ensuring compatibility with your customer data templates.
